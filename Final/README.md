CSE 150 - Introduction to Computer Networks
Final Project - Implementing a Simple Router
Description: This project implment a simple network using Mininet and POX
controller to manage network traffic and enforce communication rules
between different hosts and floors in an emulated network environment. The
primary objectives include ensuring proper node creation, link
establishment, IP address assignment, and testing communication
constraints between trusted and untrusted hosts.
Files Included:
- project.pdf: A report of the project, shwocasing the outputs of the
codes, test results, and a conclusions.
- finalcontroller_skel.py: Python script for the POX controller,
defining the network policies and rules.
- final_skel.py: Python script to set up the network topology in
Mininet.
- README: README file
