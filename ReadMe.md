<h1>CSE150: Introduction to Computer Networks</h1>

<h3>Course Overview</h2
                     
**CSE150:** Introduction to Computer Networks provides a foundational understanding of computer network architectures and protocols, with a primary focus on the fundamental protocols that form the backbone of the Internet. 
The course emphasizes both theoretical and practical learning, combining lectures with hands-on lab exercises to reinforce key concepts.

**Topics Covered**
- Network architectures and their components

- Core Internet protocols, including TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS

- Routing and switching fundamentals

- Network security principles

- Packet analysis and data communication

**Lab Exercises**

The lab portion of the course allows students to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. We worked with a network of routers, switches, and Linux-based computers to:

- Configure and troubleshoot networks

- Analyze packet flows

- Explore real-world applications of protocols

This repository contains materials and projects I developed as part of the CSE150 coursework. It includes and labs I did and documentation as well the final assignment. 

**Skills Gained**

Through this course, I developed the following skills:

- Understanding of network protocols and how they interact

- Configuration and management of routers and switches

- Packet-level network analysis

- Practical troubleshooting in a networked environment

**How to Use This Repository**

Feel free to explore the files and documentation to gain insights into computer networking basics. Note that some files might require specific software or configurations to run (e.g., Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer, or Linux command-line tools).
